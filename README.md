- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bhuvan1786.
- The Library Management Project  is made only with the help of @ Spyder and Mysql Database 
- It is a basic library management Project which can be used to lessen the work load of librarian as the data stored is safe and always secure.
- It contains the basic finctions like adding books to database ,Info of person issuning and submiting them.
- It is not only a Library managemnt tool ,but also i have used Speech Recognizer Module to get the voice assistant and speech to text ,etc,just in case Librarain feel weary to type the command ,so he/she can give command with voice .This Makes program more advanced .
